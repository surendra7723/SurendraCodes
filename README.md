👋 Hey there! I'm a tech enthusiast who's passionate about web development and cybersecurity. 
💻 After exploring the world of cybersecurity, I've found my true calling in web development. 
I'm currently in love with the MVT structure of Django and I'm constantly learning new things about this amazing Python-based web framework. 
🌟 I'm always on the lookout for new ideas to implement what I've learned and I'm excited to take on new challenges. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with Linux and creating virtual machines. 🐧 Let's connect and build something awesome together!
